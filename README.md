# Raiden Ei v2: The Music Update, now live. Raiden Ei was created by SimpCast Productions.

**SimpCast Productions reignites Ei's consciousness as they expands to new frontiers**

Raiden Ei, like other bots in the SimpCast Productions / Griffin & Kryuger arsenal are created with Akarui's aoi.js, and we are very thankful to leref and the aoi.js development team for such an efficient and easier way to develop discord bots.


# Installation

I recommend installing this through VSCode or any other IDE for a more organized experience.

## **Step 1: Installing Dependencies**

**Method 1:** 
`npm i` 
installs all dependencies

**Method 2:**
`npm i python3`
`npm i aoi.js`
`npm i @akarui/aoi.music`

**optional installations**
`npm i npm`
`npm i node`

## Step 2: Setting up Your Own Bot

> navigate to config.json, then copy your Bot token into the token variable.
> You can then set three custom prefixes for your bot to use (Make sure to use prefixes that do not conflict with other bots)

## Step 3: Tweaking and Running your bot

Congratulations! You've successfully set up your bot!
simply type ```node index.js``` in the terminal and wait for it to start!
